    <p>the room is cut in half by steel prison bars.</p>
    <p>in the cell is a bed made of hay, a bucket, and one single window.</p>
    <p>you feel a force push you through the open cell door.</p>
    <p>you try to get up. you try to see who pushed you.</p>
    <p>the cell door slams shut.</p>
    <p>well, now you have all the time in the world to figure out to get out of here.</p>
